# coyote anti missile system
### (last readme update: 7/29/24)
this is a space engineers script that i am almost too dumb to make at all
it's designed specifically for a particularly ship which i will upload to the se workshop probably never
think alysius' [diamond dome](https://github.com/wellstat/SpaceEngineers/blob/master/IngameScripts/DiamondDomeDefense.cs) but worse in basically every conceivable way

there were going to be some meaningful improvements but i think we're gonna cancel phase 2.
though i might end up doing refhack missiles in the future since the guidance and all is pretty fun.
for now missile guidance is handled by WHAMC, a dysfunctional fork of [WHAM](https://github.com/Whiplash141/SpaceEngineersScripts/blob/master/Released/WHAM.cs) using external pbs
there are abt five billion bugs so if any actual human being is viewing this page (unlikely) i suggest not using this unless you want to a) feel pain or b) laugh at me 
(the second one is more fun)
