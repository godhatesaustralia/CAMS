# coyote anti missile system
### (last readme update: 7/29/24)
this is a space engineers script that i am almost too dumb to make at all
it's designed specifically for a particularly ship which i will upload to the se workshop probably never
think alysius' diamond dome but worse in basically every conceivable way

there were going to be some meaningful improvements but i think we're gonna cancel phase 2.
though i might end up doing refhack missiles in the future since the guidance is pretty fun
